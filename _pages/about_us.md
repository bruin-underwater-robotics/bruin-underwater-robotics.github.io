                    The Bruin Underwater Robotics (BUR) project was founded in 2020 as a part of ASME at UCLA. The project focuses on helping its members learn real-world engineering skills by designing, creating, and testing an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to compete at the MATE ROV Competition.

                    The BUR project offers something most students won't get from school: the opportunity to take a complex project from start to finish. Comprised of students from majors all across UCLA, the multi-disciplinary team starts from scratch to go from design and prototyping to manufacturing and testing a brand new ROV that all members can be proud of. The focus on a rapid design, build, test, and iterate process allows all students the opportunity to learn, and no one leaves the project without learning something substantial.

                    Because of the complexity of such a large project, we always welcome new members to join the team and will never turn anyone away. Our collaborative mindset allows all students to build essential communication and leadership abilities as they ensure that everyone's ideas are considered and only the best ones rise to the top. Combined with the litany of technical skills they pick up, such as CAD, 3D printing, soldering, machining, and more, the students become much more well-rounded in many of the skills they would never learn in class.
