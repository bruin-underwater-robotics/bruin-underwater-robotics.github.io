        While the entirety of the 2020-2021 school year was spent online, BUR still moved forward as a project. We used the time to research different ways to make our ROV, and came out of the year with a preliminary design of what it could look like. We conducted trade studies on different components that we could potentially use, identifying areas of optimization and attempting to find the best solution to meet all our ROV's requirements. Overall, we had a productive year, culminating in a final CAD along with a design report, detailing all the research we did for future years to use as a reference.
