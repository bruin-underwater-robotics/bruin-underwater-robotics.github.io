    <h1>AMBITION</h1>
    <div class="bur-text">
        The 2023-2024 year is our teamâ€™s first time competing in a RoboSub competition. We are debuting our robot, AMBITION, with one of the main objectives of our robot being accessibility, providing us more time for testing and optimization than in previous years in preparation for the new challenge of a RoboSub competition. Other primary goals for our robot are to complete the gate and torpedo tasks. In addition, we seek to attempt and complete the grabbing arm tasks. <br/><br/>

        Our team of students had to consistently work on outlining and testing various parts of the underwater vehicle, such as chassis, dive ops, and electronics, allowing us to divide the workload into separate groups. Each subteam had to optimize its design as the year continued and everyone's knowledge and skill sharpened. And because AMBITION taught us a lot about maximizing efficiency for accessibility, this will serve as a good basis for next year's design.
