                For the 2022-2023 year, we built off the previous robots to create something more optimized, while also utilizing new mechanisms. Our team of students had to consistently work on design and testing then optimizing as the year went on and more about the information about the competition was released. In our second year, we were able to once again complete our robot and film our entry video, qualifying for the World Finals. This year contained a large amount of team members who were new to the team, and everyone was able to improve immensely and sharpen their skills. From the year, we learned a lot about how to properly optimize our robot, and were able to set a great baseline for future builds.
