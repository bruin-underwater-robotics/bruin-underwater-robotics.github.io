    <div class="bur-text">
        The 2021-2022 year provided an opportunity for us to compete at the MATE competition for the first time. Throughout the year, our team of over 40 students focused on constantly designing, testing, and iterating the ROV to make it competition ready. Despite the fact it was our first year, we placed 2nd in our region at the competition, qualifying for the World Finals. The year served as a great learning experience for everyone, especially those who had little to no experience in the lab. From the year, we learned a lot about where we want to go as a project, and how we can improve in the future.
