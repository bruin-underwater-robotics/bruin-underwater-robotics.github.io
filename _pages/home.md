                <span style="font-weight:700">Bruin Underwater Robotics</span> is a technical project part of the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) student branch at UCLA, dedicated to creating autonomous underwater vehicles (or AUVs) capable of operating in and exploring underwater environments. Underwater robotics is a unique field with numerous applications: ocean cleanup, marine biology research, deep sea exploration, and more. These environments provide exceptional engineering challenges that require creative problem-solving involving areas such as fluid dynamics, heat transfer, mechanisms, and circuit design. <br/><br/>

                Through the process of designing, fabricating, and testing a robot to perform those tasks under these conditions, members will learn about and draw from many areas of engineering knowledge, skill, and theory to collaboratively produce a fully functional and useful underwater robot.
